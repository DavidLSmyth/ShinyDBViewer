# ShinyDBViewer
A database viewer written using the Shiny library. This code was written due to frustration of being asked to pay for database
explorers such as Navicat, SQL PRO etc. The application is very lightweight and is intended to be a development browser for prototypical application
development such as django web apps with a database back end.
