# ShinyDBViewer
A database viewer written using the Shiny library. This code was written because of the frustration of being asked to pay for database explorers such as Navicat, SQL PRO etc. after using a free trial. The application is very lightweight and is intended to be a highly flexible development browser for prototypical application development such a django web app that uses a database (possibly development, staging and production).

## Set up
Run pip -install -r Requirments/requirements.txt to install the python requirements for the database tests (not necessary if you just want to view the database)
Run installPackages.R from Rstudio (or using the command line if R has been added to your system path).
